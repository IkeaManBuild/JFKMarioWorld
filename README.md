# JFK Mario World
A remake of super mario world in C++, can be considered a engine. for mario games.

## The features?
* Fully working engine, physics ripped and ported from original game as close as possible (except collision).
* Unfinished, but working ASM 65c18 processor.
* Lua Support for level scripting, sprites, and everything.
* Multiplayer! Though a little buggy.
* Unfinished soon to be level editor, Solar Energy (currently just a level viewer)
* No limitations. When it's complete, we aim to have zero limitations (other than the .bin files, etc)
* 4bpp gfx rendering, OAM with more features, rotation, etc

## How can I help?
If you know how to code, submit fixes. If you like to test stuff, test the craziest stuff you can think of and try to find bugs, then report them in issues. Everything helps! We especially need help on making the game physics accurate. Also if a multiplayer server is up, help us test the netcode by just playing the game.
